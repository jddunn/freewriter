# freewriter: web-text-editor-and-scrambler
A clean, minimal text editor made in JavaScript that lets you instantly scramble / unscramble all the text saved on the page, allowing you to easily keep other people from seeing what you're writing. Also has real-time, randomized cryptography mode, based on an oscillating "lock" UI using P5.js.
