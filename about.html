    <p> this is a web text editor designed for the security and privacy of your writing,
      especially in public places where you might want to keep away from wandering eyes.
      there are some basic real-time cryptography features, and none of your work is
      stored on the site or sent anywhere else. very soon you'll be able to export your text as PDF files.  
      <br><br>
      press the 'secure' button on the homepage to hide your true writing with
      word scrambling, then click 'visible' to change it back to normal. or just tap the
      'CTRL' button on your keyboard to quickly turn word scrambling on / off. 
      <br><br>
       you can also protect your work with ciphers that you may enter. this cryptography definitely isn't meant to be secure, but convenient. however, there's no limit to what characters your cipher can be, or how many you choose, so make it a unique one! the 'e' button is for encoding, 'd' is for decoding. whenever you come back to this site, you can use the same cipher to decode previously encrypted texts!
      <br><br>
       the site also allows you to auto-encrypt your text randomly on and off, based on the collisions of the oscillating balls. soon more security features and text editing features will be added.
