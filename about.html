    <p> This is a web text editor designed for the security and privacy of your writing,
      especially in public places where you might want to keep away from wandering eyes.
      There are some basic real-time cryptography features, and none of your work is
      stored on the site. Very soon you'll be able to export your text as PDF files.  
      <br><br><br>
      Press the 'secure' button on the homepage to hide your true writing with
      word scrambling, then click 'visible' to change it back to normal. Or just tap the
      'CTRL' button on your keyboard to quickly turn word scrambling on / off. 
      <br><br><br>
       You can also protect your work with ciphers, that you may enter or the site
       can gemerate them automatically. 'e' is for encoding, 'd' is for decoding. 
      <br><br>
      The cryptography definitely isn't meant to be secure, but conveinent. It's very easy
      to break the code, and it remains static, so that you can actually take previously-encrypted text to decode again on this site, so long as you remember which unique
      cipher key you choose (there is no limit to what symbols or how many of them you use).
