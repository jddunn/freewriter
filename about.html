    <p> This is a web text editor made in JavaScript that allows you to instantly scramble all the words
      on your page, so you can keep your work and notes away from any nosy, prying eyes. Press the 'secure' button 
      on the homepage to hide your true writing, then click the 'visible' button to change it back to normal.
      To quickly turn scrambling on or off while you're typing, press the "CTRL" key. <br><br>You'll want to click on / use
      the 'secure' feature multiple times until the length of the scrambled texts is to your liking.</p>
